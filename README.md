* Tutorial on hackster.io: https://www.hackster.io/katelyngan77/opencv-for-exoplanet-detection-75d9ed
Demonstration Code  Â© 2023-2024 Katelyn Gan (katelyngan77@gmail.com) 
HD101501 data set is provided by Yale EXPRES, the EXtreme PREcision SPectrograph.
Description: This code demonstrates the concept and procedures of applying Computer Vision techniques to analyze stellar spectra and extract Radial Velocities (RV) for exoplanet detection. 

How to run the demonstration: With all the data files in place, run "CV_Approach_for_RV_Extraction_Code_Demo.py".

Code output:
